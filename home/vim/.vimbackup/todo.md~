### C-Code Implementation 
1. Modify the existing C language program (a new CCS project) by adding a new function 
   that prints one character at a time via the UART from a string of characters to the 
   hyperterminal display. 
   - This function should continue printing characters until the 
     null character is reached (0x00) indicating an end of a string. 
   - Passed to this function should be the starting address of the string. 
     Nothing is needed to be returned by this function.

2.  Add the string “Laboratory #2 for EEL4742 Embedded Systems” to the C language 
    program generated in Step 7. 
    - Using the C language program developed in Step 7 build the project, debug and 
      then execute this project. 
    - Verify that the program displayed on the hyperterminal screen is 
      ”Laboratory #2 for EEL4742 Embedded Systems”.

3. Write a new C language program (a new CCS project) that inputs from the 
   keyboard the uppercase ASCII characters “G” or “Y”. 
   - Once the upper case letter “G” is entered, the green light on the experimenter 
     board turns on and stays on until the upper case letter “G” is entered again. 
   - At this point, the green LED turns off. The same operation applies for the yellow LED.

4. Write a new C language program (a new CCS project) that reads the status of SW1 and SW2 
   on the experimenter board and displays a one on the hyperterminal display if the button is pressed, 
   otherwise it displays a zero. 
   - For example, the display output on the hyperterminal display if SW1 is pressed and SW2 is not pressed is:
        SW1 = 1, SW2 = 0
