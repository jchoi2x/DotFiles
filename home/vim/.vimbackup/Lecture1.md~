## What is algorithm ?
   - Algorithm: A sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem
   - 'unambiguous' means not exactly specified (ie 'pinch of salt')

## Euclidean Algorithm  (gcd)
  - What is a valid algorithm?
## Complexity of Planarity Algorithms

## Why study algorithms?
  - Theoretical importance 
    - the core of computer science
  - Practical importance
    - A practitioners toolkit of known algorithms
    - Framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for new problems

## Two main issues related to algorithms
  1. How to design algorithms
  2.
